## Project brief
A local trader has come to you with a portfolio of shares. She wants to be able to analyse it more effectively. She has a small sample data set to give you and would like you to build a Minimum Viable Product that uses the data to display her portfolio so that she can make better decisions.

## MVP

A user should be able to:

- Add/Remove/Update/Delete Shares.
- View total current value.
- View individual and total performance trends.
- Retrieve a list of share prices from an external API and add shares to their portfolio.
- View a chart of the current values in their portfolio.

## Extensions

- View current share price of individual shareholdings.
- View average and total paid prices for individual shares in the portfolio.
- View a chart of total paid price, total value and profit/loss.
- Implement a search box to find a specific stock using external API data.
- Temporarily add searched and selected stock to compare.
- Compare past share performance data for any publicly traded company.
